## Global Shortcuts

These shortcuts work anywhere in the application (except when typing in text input fields, unless noted).

| Shortcut | Action | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| `Ctrl/Cmd + Enter` | Generate code | Works even when focused on input fields |
| `Ctrl/Cmd + K` | Clear prompt | Resets the text input area |
| `Ctrl/Cmd + B` | Toggle sidebar | Show/hide the history sidebar |
| `Ctrl/Cmd + 1` | Switch to Preview | Live rendered preview mode |
| `Ctrl/Cmd + 2` | Switch to Code view | Syntax-highlighted read-only view |
| `Ctrl/Cmd + 3` | Switch to Editor | Monaco live editor mode |
| `Ctrl/Cmd + E` | Open Export dialog | Download and export options |
| `Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + S` | Open Share dialog | URL sharing with compression |
| `Ctrl/Cmd + Z` | Undo | Revert to previous generation |
| `Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + Z` | Redo | Restore undone generation |
| `Esc` | Close dialogs | Dismisses any open modal/dialog |

## Notes

- On macOS, use `Cmd` instead of `Ctrl`
- Shortcuts are disabled when typing in text input fields or the code editor to avoid conflicts, except for `Ctrl/Cmd + Enter` which always triggers generation
- The undo/redo stack stores up to 20 items in each direction
- Shortcut hints are displayed in the toolbar buttons as tooltips
